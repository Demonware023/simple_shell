Project Title: ALX C Simple Shell Project

Project Objective: To develop a robust shell program capable of emulating the functionalities of the Unix Shell/Bourne Again Shell (bash) using the C programming language.


Project Overview

The ALX C - simple shell group project is a comprehensive undertaking that challenges students to develop a robust shell program capable of emulating the functionalities of the Unix Shell/Bourne Again Shell (bash). This project forms a crucial component of the low-level programming and algorithm curriculum at the renowned ALX Holberton School. This project is a challenging and rewarding experience that provides students with hands-on experience in various aspects of shell programming. Through this project, students gain a deep understanding of low-level programming concepts, system calls, and process management. They also develop their problem-solving and debugging skills, which are essential for success in the field of software engineering.

Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the ALX C - simple shell group project are to:

- Develop a shell program that emulates the functionalities of the Unix Shell/Bourne Again Shell (bash).
- Gain hands-on experience in parsing input commands, executing commands, managing child processes, handling input/output redirection, and implementing environmental variable manipulation.
- Build a simple command-line interface (CLI) that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the shell.
- Enhance problem-solving and debugging skills through the application of low-level programming concepts to a real-world programming task.


Project Requirements

The ALX C - simple shell group project stipulates a range of specific requirements that the shell program must fulfill, including:

- Execution of external programs using the execve system calls.
- Background process handling with the fork and waitpid system calls.



Project Completion

The ALX/Holberton Coding school's C: simple shell project was created by Julien Barbier, the instructor at the school. In this project, we are tasked with building a Unix simple shell using the C programming language and implementing specific functionalities.
This project has transformed my perspective on shells and has allowed me to delve deeper into the intricate workings of shells. Although I initially attempted to tackle this project on my own, I was unable to make significant progress. However, with the assistance of ChatGPT and other AI tools, I was able to complete the project successfully. The project was completed solely by Awam Chimere Marvel. Numerous concepts initially taught during the beginning of the C programming language course were essential for completing this project. These concepts included system calls and more.

The project includes an AUTHORS file located in the root directory of the repository.

This project was very time-consuming but also provided an opportunity to revisit previous topics and projects, refreshing my memory on concepts that I had not been able to re-visit due to insufficient time.
The simple shell project provided me with hands-on experience in combining all the previously taught concepts and projects from the ALX/Holberton Coding school to create a fully functional program. Since embarking on the ALX program, diving into C, and completing this project, I can confidently say that I deeply understand how the shell works and how it serves as a bridge between the user and the computer. I also understand how the shell executes commands and how these commands are executable files stored in binary format. Before embarking on this project, I had no idea that I could create a shell or the commands that the shell functions with. Additionally, I was not aware that these commands are files located within my system that I could easily navigate to.
This project has provided me with a real behind-the-scenes look at how I communicate with the computer using the terminal/command prompt. Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how easy communication between the computer and a user is created.

The renowned Simple Shell project encapsulates everything I have learned so far:

Basics of programming
Basics of C
Basics of thinking like an engineer
Learning how to learn
Since joining ALX, I have been able to accomplish multiple things that I never knew I could do with a laptop/system. This exciting project has demonstrated my ability to build my own shell and terminal.


The successful completion of the ALX C - simple shell group project demonstrates a student's proficiency in shell programming and their ability to apply low-level programming concepts to build functional software applications. Students who successfully complete this project are well-equipped to tackle more advanced programming challenges and pursue careers in software engineering.
